## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Install Python

- For Windows:
    1. Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
    2. Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

- For macOS/Linux:
    1. Open terminal
    2. Run:

- For macOS/Linux:
    1. Open terminal.
    2. Run:
    ```bash
    ./install-requirements.sh

### 3️⃣ Install Certificate

1. Since the app uses HTTPS, you need to install the provided ***cert.pem*** file.
2. Follow the instructions in [CERTIFICATE_SETUP.md](CERTIFICATE_SETUP.md) to install ***cert.pem***.

### 4️⃣ Start the Server

- For Windows:
    1. Open PotPlayer and pause your video.
    2. Run ***start.bat*** to start the server.
    3. The server console will display a URL (e.g., *https://192.168.x.x:5000*).

- For macOS/Linux:
    1. Open PotPlayer and pause your video.

    4. The server console will display a URL (e.g., *https://192.168.x.x:5000*).

### 5️⃣ Use the App

1. Open the URL on your Android/iOS device.
2. Add the app to your home screen for quick access. *(Optional but Recommended)*
    - Adding the app to your home screen saves you from typing the URL every time.
